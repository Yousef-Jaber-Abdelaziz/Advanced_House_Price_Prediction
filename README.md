# Advanced House Price Prediction
## üè° Introduction
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a rich set of features that describe various attributes of homes, their surrounding areas, and market conditions. Developed as part of a data competition, the goal is to predict housing prices using advanced machine learning techniques.

The dataset includes features such as:

Square footage
Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
Age of the property
Neighborhood and proximity to amenities
Our objective is to build a robust model that can make accurate predictions based on these features.
