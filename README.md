# Advanced House Price Prediction

## 🏡 Introduction

> This project focuses on predicting house prices using a rich set of features that describe various attributes of homes, their surrounding areas, and market conditions. Developed as part of a data competition, the goal is to predict housing prices using advanced machine learning techniques.
> 
> The dataset includes features such as:
> - **Square footage**
> - **Number of bedrooms and bathrooms**
> - **Age of the property**
> - **Neighborhood and proximity to amenities**
> 
> Our objective is to build a robust model that can make accurate predictions based on these features.
